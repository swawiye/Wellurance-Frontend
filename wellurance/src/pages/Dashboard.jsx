                        lives, property, and the environment. They rescue people from dangerous situations, 
                        extinguish fires, and provide first aid when needed. Firefighters also work closely with 
                        ambulance teams and other responders to handle emergencies quickly and safely. Through our 
                        real-time emergency platform, theyâ€™re dispatched instantly and tracked live to ensure the 
                        fastest possible response.
